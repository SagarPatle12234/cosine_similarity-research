# 🧠 Cosine Similarity Research – Hybrid Applications in AI Assistants and Vision Systems

This project explores the power of **cosine similarity** and its hybrid use in **Natural Language Processing**, **command recognition**, and **computer vision**.

## 📌 About the Project

While building an AI assistant inspired by Jarvis, I explored how cosine similarity can help interpret voice/text commands by comparing user queries against predefined commands using **Cohere embeddings**.

That curiosity led to this research notebook.
